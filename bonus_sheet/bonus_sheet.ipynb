    "\n",
    "In the file `bonus_sheet_data.json`, you can find real-world data gathered from the movie quiz podcast [\"Wendeltreppe ins Nichts\"](https://wendeltreppe.letscast.fm/). The data was gathered with explicit consent from each involved party.\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie quiz is a competetive game between two players. Each episode consists of five rounds. In each round, the goal is to be the first to guess the correct moview. As hints, the quizmaster/moderator/host provides reviews (in German language) of the film. The first review is typically highly ambiguous, whereas later reviews are more specific. Each round continues until the correct film is guessed.\n",

    "The structure of the JSON data mimics the structure of the game itself. Here is the start of the data file for illustration:\n",
